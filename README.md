# Hi there! I'm José👋

I'm a recent **Actuarial Science graduate** from the BUAP, currently in the process of completing my dissertation.

I am passionate about transforming data into solutions and strategies. I am actively seeking my first professional opportunity in **Risk Analysis, Finance, Banking, or Data Science**, where I can apply my skills to solve complex problems.
